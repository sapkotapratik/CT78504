## Java Basics(Review)

--> Top-Down Approach to the concepts.

### 1) Object-oriented Programming

- Model real-world scenarios in a natural way

- Object is used to represent real world entity

- Objects are defined by a class. Class is like a blueprint and objects are instances of a class.


### 2) Variables

- Container that hold something

- A type of data varialbe can hold is defined at the variable creation time itself by stating the variable types.

- Java is a statically-typed language.

- Variable types: primitive  & object references.

- 8 primitive data types.

  - Variable kinds
  
      o) Instances
    
      o) Static 
    
      o) Local 
  
      - Instance variable are unique to each object and they hold an object state. 
  
      - Static variable are class variables that are shared across all objects of the class.
  
      - Local variables are defined within mehthods or constructors. Even method paraemeter and constructor parameter are considered as local varialbes.
  
  
 ### 3) Arrays
  
 - In Java, Array is an object.
 
 - It get stored on the heap like other regular java object.
 
 - It stores fixed no of elements of a single type.Type can be either primitive or object reference.
 
 - Supports fast random access. Constant time O(1).
 
 
 ### 4) Methods
 
 - Define or represents behavior.
 
 - Java always uses pass by value mechanism while passing data to methods.Even for object references it passes a copy of the memory address of the object.
 
 - To overload, parameter list MUST be different.
 
 
 ### 5) Constructors:
 
 - Invoked when object is being created.
 
 - Initializes the object state.
 
 - We can have multiple constructor on the same class.
 
          - this()
              o) invokes overloades constructor
              
              o) MUST be constructor's first element.
